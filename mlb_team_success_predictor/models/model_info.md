## Model Training Details

### Data
- Historical MLB data from 1901-2024
- Modern era (2006+) emphasized for recent predictions
- Features engineered using domain expertise

### Validation Strategy
- Time-based train/validation/test split
- Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Out-of-time testing on recent seasons

### Update Schedule
- Models retrained annually after season completion
- Mid-season updates possible for significant changes
- Version control maintained for all models

## Usage

```python
import joblib

# Load a model
model_dict = joblib.load('saved_models/division_classifier.pkl')
model = model_dict['model']
feature_names = model_dict['feature_names']

# Load corresponding scaler
scaler_dict = joblib.load('scalers/classification_scaler.pkl')
scaler = scaler_dict['scaler']

# Make predictions
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X[feature_names])
predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
